## Creating a Virtual Environment (python 3.8.10)

I always like to run all my code in a seperate virtual environment to seperate it from my other projects due to dependecy conflicts<br>

* launch cmd 
* move to your desired directory
* Run the following:
```python -m venv mario```

activate your virtual env using following:<br>
```.\mario\Scripts\activate```<br>
to deactivte just type<br>
_deactivate_ in cmd

After above steps open your terminal (should remember to activate the venv) and type <br>
